# ANOVA-Test-COVID-19

# **Introduction:**
We are grappling with a pandemic that’s operating at a never-before-seen scale. Researchers all over the globe are frantically trying to develop a vaccine or a cure for COVID-19 while doctors are just about keeping the pandemic from overwhelming the entire world.

I recently had an idea to apply my statistical knowledge to the trove of COVID-19 data from Ministry of Home Affairs, India.

In this project, I’ll introduce you to the ANOVA test and its different types that are being used to make better decisions. The icing on the cake? I’ll demonstrate each type of ANOVA test in Python to visualize how they work on COVID-19 Data. So let’s get going!


# Directory Structure
* **Data :** This directory has input files that you'll need to important orginal Data. You can import this data from [Kaggle contest](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india?select=StatewiseTestingDetails.csv) as well. However, I'll encourage you to explore Ministry of Home Affairs, India [website](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), considering the data is coming from there only.
* **Processed Data:** This directory has data that has been produced during the experiment. You can run the attached python notebook for better understanding.
* **One Way ANOVA Test.ipynb:** This will demonstrate One-Way ANOVA test on real time COVID-19 Data.
* **Two Way ANOVA Test.ipynb:**  This will demonstrate Two-Way ANOVA test on real time COVID-19 Data.

# Instructions for Installation
Download Dataset from the above Link and store the files in the data folder. Run any of the Python notebook according to the task desired

**Dependencies:**
* pandas: 1.0.1
* numpy: 1.18.1
* scipy: 1.4.1
* statsmodels: 0.11.0
* matplotlib: 3.1.3
* seaborn: 0.10.0

The code has been tested on Windows system. It should work well on other distributions but has not yet been tested.
